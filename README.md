In mathematics, if given an open subset U of R^2 and a subinterval I of R, one says that a function u : U × I → R is a solution of the heat equation if

where (x, y, t) denotes a general point of the domain. It is typical to refer to t as "time" and x, y as "spatial variables," even in abstract contexts where these phrases fail to have their intuitive meaning. For any given value of t, the right-hand side of the equation is the Laplacian of the function u(•, t) : U → R.

α is the diffusivity constant
